# [Project Mu](https://microsoft.github.io/mu/) UEFI Implementation for Qualcomm Snapdragonâ„¢ Devices

<!-- ![Banner](https://github.com/Robotix22/Mu-Qcom/blob/main/Pictures/Banner.png) -->

## Description

This repo brings UEFI Firmware on your Device (If supported) to boot OSs like Windows or Linux.

## How to build UEFI for Quest 2 (codename: hollywood)

1. Setup build environment (in resources, "Building" guide)
2. Build UEFI for Quest 2 with command (Or skip building and download the image from releases):
```
./build_uefi.sh -d hollywood --release DEBUG
```
3. Boot the generated Mu-hollywood.img with fastboot:
```
fastboot boot Mu-hollywood.img
```
4. It probably won't boot the first time and there will be errors, please send the log errors to me, I will try to fix it (I can't test with my own Quest 2, locked bootloader)

## FAQ

#### How is this different from any other Qualcomm WoA Project?

```
Not Much is different, The only Thing we do different here is making a Stable and Safe UEFI for Phones / Tablets.
Not Saying the Other WoA Projects are Bad, Make sure to check them out too!
```

#### Can my Phone / Tablet run this UEFI?

```
Check the Status Page to see if your Device can run this UEFI.
```

#### What if, My Device isn't Supported?

```
We have Porting Guides that will Guide you through the Porting Process.
(And Please don't try Images from another Devices on yours. Please.)
```

#### Can I run this on any Other Chipsets like Rockchip?

```
Unfortunately No, This Repo is only dedicated to Qualcomm Devices.
But we have Other Repos that Support other Chipsets like Tegra or Exynos.
